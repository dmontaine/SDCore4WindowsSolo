"""RESTORE.ACCOUNT LATEST picks the newest backup made on this computer that holds the account.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Owner's request, 2 Oct 2026: restore the most recent backup without
typing its name, on both ports.  sdsys/gpl.bp/restorea is SHARED with SD Core for Linux
byte for byte, so the rule has to live in one place and not drift.  The choice is made from
the FILE NAME alone (backupa writes SD-<host>-<what>-<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>.zip), which is what
this guard models.

WHAT IT PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  A Python model of the rule is run over names, with
mutants, and the BASIC text is checked for the same elements (the model and the BASIC are
two copies of one rule, so each element the model relies on is looked for in the source).
THE BASIC ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN RUN BY THIS GUARD: bbcmp compiles it (checked by hand, 2 Oct
2026, with a HEAD control), and a cycle plus a real LATEST restore is what runs it.

  python gplbld/test-restorelatest-units.py

Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 the tree is not there to read.
