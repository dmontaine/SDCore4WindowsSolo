"""RESTORE.ACCOUNT LATEST picks the newest backup made on this computer that holds the account.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Owner's request, 2 Oct 2026: restore the most recent backup without
typing its name, on both ports.  sdsys/gpl.bp/restorea is SHARED with SD Core for Linux
byte for byte, so the rule has to live in one place and not drift.  backupa writes
SD-<host>-<what>-<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>.zip; the file name is a first cut (pick()), and since
5 Oct 2026 (owner) each zip it admits is OPENED and the newest whose MANIFEST holds every
named account is chosen (choose()): a newer backup that lacks the account is reported
(13049), and none that holds it is 13047.  Both are modelled here.

WHAT IT PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  A Python model of the rule is run over names, with
mutants, and the BASIC text is checked for the same elements (the model and the BASIC are
two copies of one rule, so each element the model relies on is looked for in the source).
THE BASIC ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN RUN BY THIS GUARD: bbcmp compiles it (checked by hand, 2 Oct
2026, with a HEAD control), and a cycle plus a real LATEST restore is what runs it.
