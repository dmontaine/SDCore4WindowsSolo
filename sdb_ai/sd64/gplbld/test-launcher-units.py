"""The second command name for this product is a launcher that cannot reach another install.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Owner's ruling, 1 Oct 2026: "sd" and "sd-full" start the FULL
SD Core for Windows when both it and SD Core Solo are installed, "sd-solo" starts
Solo, and with one installed "sd" starts that one.  This product's own name,
sd-solo, is a one-line text launcher beside its own sd.exe (no binary: this
repository ships none).  Three things make it safe and each is easy to lose in a
tidy-up:

  1. it runs the sd.exe BESIDE ITSELF ("%~dp0sd.exe"), never one found on the PATH -
     a launcher that searched would start the full product's sd.exe from Solo's name,
     which is the system-PATH one and comes first;
  2. it passes the arguments through (%*), or "sd-full WHERE" would run "sd" with none;
  3. it returns the program's exit code, or a script calling it sees success on failure.

And stage.py has to ship it into usr\\bin beside sd.exe (which is also what puts it on
the PATH), or the name does not exist on an installed system.

A source check: no install, no SD, no elevation.  The mutants run on synthetic text.
The behaviour (arguments, exit codes, a folder with a space in it, by name through
cmd.exe) was measured with a stand-in program on 1 Oct 2026 and is repeated by hand at
a cycle; this keeps the text from drifting between cycles.

Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 the tree is not there to read.
