"""This product's IPC keys are its own, and the object NAMES carry them.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Owner, 2 Oct 2026 (Linux session): each of the four SD Core
products gets its own shared-memory and semaphore key so they can run side by
side, and none may reuse the 0x716d family OpenQM, ScarletDME and upstream SD
use.  The family was agreed with SD Core for Linux:

    Linux 0x53434C01/02   Linux Solo 0x53434C11/12
    Windows 0x53435701/02   Windows Solo 0x53435711/12

ON WINDOWS THE KEYS DO NOT SEPARATE ANYTHING BY THEMSELVES.  Nothing calls
shmget() or semget(); the segment is a POSIX shm_open() name and the semaphores
are Win32 "Global\\" names (gplsrc/sddefs.h), and each name had the old key's
digits written into it.  The instruction as sent named only the two defines -
right for Linux - and following it here would have left every Windows product
on the old names, still colliding, with the keys looking correct.  So this
checks the NAMES against the keys, which is the part that would have been missed.

It is a source check: no SD, no install, no elevation.  The mutants run on
synthetic text, never on the file.

  python gplbld/test-ipcnames-units.py

Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 sddefs.h is not there to read.
