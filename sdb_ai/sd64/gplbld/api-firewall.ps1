#
# Exit 0 applied, 1 failed, 2 refused.  ELEVATED - creating a firewall rule is
# a machine-wide change.  -Show and -ScopeFile are the two read-only modes and
# neither takes the elevation gate.
#
# 01 Oct 26 - THE PORT IS 4249 AND THERE IS NO -Port.  The owner ruled the API
# port fixed and not adjustable (SD_API_PORT in gplsrc/sddefs.h; it was 4243,
# which is OpenQM's).  A rule made by W1.1-1 or earlier still names 4243 and so
# admits nothing on 4249: -Show and -ScopeFile say so rather than describing its
# scope as if it applied, and -Retarget moves the one field, which the installer
# runs on an upgrade, where -Open and -Restrict must not run (they would change
# the scope on the strength of a box nobody saw).  -Open and -Restrict also
# correct the port of an existing rule, since they update it in place.
#
# 01 Oct 26 - SOLO'S RULE HAS ITS OWN NAME, SD-Solo-API-In-TCP.  Owner's ruling,
# the same day: the full product and Solo used one rule name, SD-API-In-TCP, in an
# identical script, and now listen on different ports (4247, 4249); installed
# together, each one's -Open, -Restrict and -Remove would have acted on the
# other's rule.  The full product keeps the old name.  A rule an older build left
# under it cannot be told from either product's, so -Retarget ADOPTS it (new name,
# new port, same scope, old rule removed) only when the full product is NOT
# installed - then nothing else could own it - and otherwise leaves it for the
# full product.  Get-LegacyPlan is that decision as a pure function, and
# test-apifirewall-units.ps1 drives it.
#
# -ScopeFile EXISTS FOR THE INSTALLER, and ssh-firewall.ps1's -ScopeFile is the
# precedent being copied.  PRE_RELEASE_FIXES 147: after an uninstall that kept
# the database and a reinstall, the API listens and its rule is gone, and the
# closing box has to say so - which it may only do if it MEASURED it.  A message
# that asserted "nobody can reach the API" from the install path alone would be
# a claim about a machine nobody looked at.
#
# THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO, and that is the difference from the ssh one.  There it
# is always a question about a rule Windows created, so "open" or "restricted"
# covers it.  Here the rule is ours and may be ABSENT, which is the whole state
# 147 is about - so a missing rule answers "none" rather than being an error.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ssh-firewall.ps1 WITH A DIFFERENT PORT, which was the first
# thing tried.  That script TOGGLES a rule somebody else created: installing
# the OpenSSH capability creates OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP and enables it, so the
# question there is only how wide it should be.  NOTHING CREATES A RULE FOR
# 4249.  So this one owns its rule - it makes it, it names it, and -Remove
# takes it away on uninstall, which ssh-firewall must never do to Microsoft's.
#
# THE RULE IS OURS, AND THE NAME SAYS SO.  An administrator reading wf.msc
# should be able to tell at a glance which rules SD put there and remove them
# with the product.  Hence the SD- prefix and a description naming the config
# parameter that decides whether anything is listening at all.
#
# RemoteAddress, NOT Enabled=False, for -Restrict.  Same reasoning as
# ssh-firewall.ps1: both leave a local client working, because Windows does not
# filter loopback, but a DISABLED rule reads as something that got switched off
# and troubleshooting switches those back on.  A rule scoped to 127.0.0.1 and
# ::1 states the intent where somebody will read it.
#
# THE PORT IS NOT READ FROM sd.conf, deliberately.  This runs during
# installation, before the data tree is necessarily complete, and sd.conf no
# longer holds a port at all - APIPORT is an on/off switch (gplsrc/config.c) and
# the port is the constant below.  gplbld/test-apiport-units.py checks that it
# is the same number as SD_API_PORT.
#
# IT DOES NOT CHECK WHETHER SD IS LISTENING, and that is not an oversight: the
# rule outlives any particular run of the service, APIPORT can be commented out
# and back in without touching the firewall, and a rule for a port nothing has
# opened yet admits nothing.  api-firewall says who MAY reach the port; sd.conf
# says whether there is one.
