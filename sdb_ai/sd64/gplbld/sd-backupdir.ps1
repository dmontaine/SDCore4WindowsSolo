# sd-backupdir.ps1 - the Windows half of SET.BACKUP.DIRECTORY: the directory BACKUP.ACCOUNT and

# Run by SD through !ps_script_out, from gpl.bp ACC_OS_BAKDIR (SOLO 25; owner's ruling, 1 Oct 2026:
# "a new command set.backup.directory that creates (if necessary) and makes persistent the backup
# path through the config file, so it need not be typed in every backup and restore command").
# Exit 0 done, 1 refused or failed.
#
# THE SAVED VALUE IS ONE LINE OF sd.conf:  BACKUPDIR=<full Windows path>.  It is read from the file
# at every use rather than from SD's memory, so SET.BACKUP.DIRECTORY takes effect without a
# restart.  gplsrc/config.c ACCEPTS the key and stores nothing: its parser ends in "Unrecognised
# configuration parameter", which stops SD starting, so a build without that branch would not start
# on a file carrying this line.
#
# On success the LAST line is "SD-BACKUPDIR <GET|SET> OK <path>" (or "SD-BACKUPDIR GET NONE"), and
# that is the only text a caller may anchor on; a refusal is one "SD-BACKUPDIR ERROR <reason>"
# line.  Every run first echoes the inputs it was really given (the mode, the path, the file).
#
# ***sd.conf IS READ AND WRITTEN AS BYTES, CRLF AND ASCII PRESERVED.***  Same reasoning as
# api-listener.ps1: Set-Content would rewrite it in the ANSI code page and round trips have
# corrupted tracked files here before.  Only the BACKUPDIR line changes; everything else is
# compared before and after, and the original is put back if it does not read back.
#
# ENGLISH ONLY (owner, 29 Sep 2026): a path with anything outside printable ASCII is refused by
# name rather than half-supported, so a file this script writes is always plain ASCII.
