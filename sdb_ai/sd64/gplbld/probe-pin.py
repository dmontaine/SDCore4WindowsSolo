"""probe-pin.py - witness first-use certificate pinning in the INSTALLED client DLL.

SOLO 24 (30 Sep 2026).  Loads the real sdclilib.dll from the Solo tree and connects to
the live API with it, against a SCRATCH known-servers store (SD_KNOWN_SERVERS), so the
user's own store is never touched.  NO REAL PASSWORD IS NEEDED OR USED: the pin is checked
after the TLS handshake and before any login byte, so a deliberately wrong password is
enough to get past it, and the login then fails as it should.

    py -3 probe-pin.py [--dll PATH] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 4249]

Every step prints what it did and what SDError said.  Verdict lines, anchored on wording
that appears only on their own path:
    PIN FIRST USE: recorded <host:port> <hex>      the store gained exactly that line
    PIN INDEPENDENT: matches                       equals sha256(DER) read by Python's ssl
    PIN SAME CERT: connected past the pin          no CHANGED / cannot-pin text
    PIN CHANGED: refused ...                       text starts "THE SERVER'S CERTIFICATE HAS
                                                   CHANGED", names pinned and now, and came
                                                   back fast (no login: a wrong-password login
                                                   sleeps 3 s on the server)
    PIN UNUSABLE STORE: refused ...                "cannot pin the server: cannot open"
Exit 0 only if every step held; 1 otherwise; 2 if it could not run."""
