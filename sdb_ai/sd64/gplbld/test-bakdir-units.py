"""SET.BACKUP.DIRECTORY and the saved backup directory: every piece is there and wired.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Owner's ruling, 1 Oct 2026: a command SET.BACKUP.DIRECTORY saves the
backup directory in the config file, and BACKUP.ACCOUNT / RESTORE.ACCOUNT use it, asking
for it - and saving the answer as if the command had been run - when there is none.
The feature is eight small pieces in four languages, and what fails when one is missing
is silent or far away:

  - the C parser must accept BACKUPDIR=, or SD does not START on a file carrying it;
  - a message number that no file backs prints nothing useful in the middle of a backup;
  - an installer that does not ship sd-backupdir.ps1 leaves SET.BACKUP.DIRECTORY failing on
    a real install while every unit test is green;
  - a question asked AFTER the login hold is taken leaves the hold standing on a refusal;
  - the VOC record is what makes the verb exist, and which layer holds it differs by product.

It is a source check: no SD, no install, no elevation.  The mutants run on synthetic text.

  python gplbld/test-bakdir-units.py

Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 the tree is not there to read.
