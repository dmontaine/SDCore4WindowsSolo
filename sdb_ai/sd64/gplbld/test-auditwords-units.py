"""test-auditwords-units.py - every word SD writes to the audit trail is lower case.

    python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-auditwords-units.py
    python3 .../test-auditwords-units.py --selftest        (mutants: each breakage must be caught)
    python3 .../test-auditwords-units.py --root DIR        (a gpl.bp directory to read instead)

Exit 0 every row passed, 1 a row failed, 2 it measured nothing.  NO INSTALL, NO SUDO, NO SD.

THE RULE (owner, 7 Oct 2026, in chat: "all command words ought to be lower case, rule", then "rule from long
ago ... lower case everywhere", then, asked whether the audit trail's own event names were an exception: "All
lower case").  An audit record is  <event words> key=value key=value ...  and the EVENT WORDS - the command
(create.account, modify.account route, remote.api) and the event name (elevation granted, api refused, login)
- are lower case.  What follows a key= is data and stays as it is: an account name in the case the port
registers it, the text of a reason=, what a caller typed in command=.

WHAT IS CHECKED, by reading gpl.bp (the only place BASIC writes the trail: kernel(K$AUDIT, ...)):
  A  every audit call's event words, the tokens before the first key=, hold no upper-case letter
  B  where the event words continue in a variable (remote.api <action>, modify.account route <word>), the
     variable is passed through downcase() or every literal assigned to it in that program is lower case
  C  create.account's type= value is passed through downcase() (it is a keyword of the command)
  D  the NULL CASE: fewer than 20 call sites seen is a broken reader, not a pass
Comment lines (a leading *) are not code and are not read.
